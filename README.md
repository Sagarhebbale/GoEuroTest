# GoEuroTest

This is a solution to the GoEuro Test with the source code, code documentation and the project files.

There were two tests posted in this link https://github.com/goeuro/iOS-Test one initially and another one later repl;acing the first one. I have implemented both solutions in this application with an extra tab to display the older solution. 

Here are some notes on the same:

1. The UI has been changed from the provided screenshot to align with the Human Interface Guidelines for iOS. Specifically the tab bar has been moved down and a navigation bar with the tool bar item (for sorting) on top.

2. Caching has been implemented for all data loaded from the network.

3. Documentation for the code base can be found in the repository under the folder Documentation.

4. Works on all iPhone screen sizes and on OS versions beyond 8.3
