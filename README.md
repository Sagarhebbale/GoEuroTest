# GoEuroTest

This is the solution for the Go Euro test as provided here https://github.com/goeuro/iOS-Test. There were two tests were given here and i have implemented both for your benefit. The older solution has been implemented as an extra tab in this application.

Some notes on the application:

1. The UX has been slightly altered to align with the Human interface guidelines for iOS. The Tab bar is moved to the bottom with a navigation bar on top. The navigation bar also has a Bar Button Item for sorting.
2. Caching has been implemented for all data loaded via REST calls, this can be tested.
3. This solution works for all iPhone screen sizes and iOS versions greater than 8.3.
